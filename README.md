# Farm Fresh Store

Welcome to the **Farm Fresh Store** - your digital destination for fresh fruits and vegetables. Our shopping cart app brings you the freshest produce direct from the farm to your doorstep with the convenience of a few clicks.

## Inspired by Learning

This app was inspired by the course "[Modern Redux with Redux Toolkit (RTK) and TypeScript](https://egghead.io/courses/modern-redux-with-redux-toolkit-rtk-and-typescript-64f243c8)" by Jamund Ferguson, available on Egghead. However, it utilizes the latest versions of the technologies covered in the project to ensure up-to-date practices and features.

## Built With

- **Vite.js:** A fast, modern build tool that provides a smooth developer experience.
- **TypeScript:** Utilized for its static type-checking ability, which ensures more reliable and maintainable code.
- **Redux with Redux Toolkit (RTK):** For efficient state management of product listings and the shopping cart.

## Prerequisites

To fully experience the app's capabilities and for ease of debugging, we recommend installing the *Redux DevTools Extension* in your web browser. This tool is invaluable for monitoring the changes in application state during development and testing.

## Getting Started

Before running the application, make sure you have the above prerequisites fulfilled. Clone the repository, install the dependencies, and you are ready to launch the Farm Fresh Store app.


```
npm install
npm run dev

Enjoy your healthy shopping experience!
